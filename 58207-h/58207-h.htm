  <i>Afternoon of a Journey</i><br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  THERE <i>will never be another,<br />
  That day was forever.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>We dove through tropic noon<br />
  Into a green sky.  The palms stood<br />
  Quiet, still, their fronds<br />
  Like swollen waves about<br />
  To break, transparent, lime limned<br />
  And streaked from base to rim<br />
  With icy light.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Lungs gilled and arms finned wide,<br />
  We slipped into the pale<br />
  Of that dry sea, following downrays<br />
  Until we reached the cool<br />
  Of silence, a sandpaved lagoon<br />
  Upholding its weight of time<br />
  Under trees that climbed.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Perched on a log, we scanned<br />
  The currents, the drifting shaft<br />
  Of shadows, instinctively alert<br />
  To armadillo's crawl, the stir<br />
  Of something red,<br />
  The eye of an iguana met...<br />
  Ourselves.  Perceiving</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>We were not alone in breathing,<br />
  Being witness,<br />
  As well as evidence<br />
  In that primal air,<br />
  How all of us shared<br />
  In the serene of a sunless glow<br />
  Which waterless flowed.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Gently, we moved along a path<br />
  That opened as we passed,<br />
  Whispering our affirmations<br />
  To those secret ones<br />
  Who flickered and flashed,<br />
  Carrying our echoes back<br />
  From near, then far, far off.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>And slowly, the silence arced,<br />
  Leaped high&mdash;and broke,<br />
  With parrots in the undertow<br />
  As the waves rolled over<br />
  And the green tide flooded<br />
  The forest floor, whirling,<br />
  Swirling a world set free.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Now all of us were cells<br />
  In a chemistry of shells<br />
  Older than snails,<br />
  Plankton or sunbaked clay,<br />
  Fellow creatures in an afternoon<br />
  As joyous as a long lost tune<br />
  About to be remembered.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Oh all of us there<br />
  In that drenched, tropic green<br />
  Began to sing and sing,<br />
  Shedding our ties<br />
  With root and rock and sky,<br />
  As we found our song<br />
  In our living bond.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Pod and leaf, mouth and beak,<br />
  Whatever lived and breathed<br />
  That sudden afternoon,<br />
  Sang wonder through the woods,<br />
  As we heard and discovered<br />
  Each in the other<br />
  Without a word.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Until a metallic bird,<br />
  On roaring wings,<br />
  Crashed our song beneath<br />
  The hammered surf,<br />
  As it thundered,<br />
  Like lightning in a storm,<br />
  Fearfully born.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Then all of us<br />
  Grew motionless<br />
  In the sculptured undersea<br />
  Of silenced green,<br />
  Knowing, as we did again,<br />
  The thing forbidden and forgotten<br />
  In a world of men.</i><br />

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Bartlett (1911-1994) was an American poet and writer noted
for her lyrical and symbolic poetry, creation of the new twelve-tone
form of poetry, founder of the international non-profit organization
Literary Olympics, Inc., and known as an author of fiction, essays,
reviews, translations, and as an editor. She is not to be confused
with the British poet (1924-2008) of the same name. For more detailed
information about her life, work, and critical commendations, see
the Wikipedia article
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bartlett_%28American_poet%29">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bartlett_%28American_poet%29
</a>.
</p>

<p>
Bartlett’s most notable achievements include:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&bull; Creation of a new form of poetry, "the twelve-tone poem," adapting
Arnold Schonberg’s musical system to the verbal, accented sounds of
language. Called "the Emily Dickinson of the 20th Century," her
concise lyrics have been praised by poets, musicians, and composers
alike.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&bull; Publication of 16 books of poetry, a group of edited anthologies,
and more than 1,000 poems, short stories, and essays published, for
example, in <i>Harper’s</i>, <i>Virginia Quarterly</i>, <i>New York Times</i>,
<i>North American Review</i>, <i>Saturday Review</i>, <i>Prairie Schooner</i>,
and in numerous international collections.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&bull; Recipient of many fellowships, grants and awards, including NEA,
PEN Syndicate, fellowships at the Huntington Hartford Foundation,
Montalvo, Yaddo, MacDowell, Dorland Mt. Colony and Ragdale, travel
grants, and honors for introducing literature as part of the Olympics.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&bull; Founder of the Literary Olympics, to restore literature,
specifically poetry, as a vital part of the Olympics as it once
had been in ancient Greece.
</p>

<p>
Bartlett’s poetry came to the attention of leading poets, writers,
and critics as diverse as Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Mark Van
Doren, Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, Alfred Kreymborg, Robert Hillyer,
Louis Untermeyer, Rolfe Humphries, John Ciardi, Richard Eberhart,
Richard Wilbur, Maxine Kumin, Robert M. Hutchins, Kenneth Rexroth,
William Stafford, and others. Over the years, Bartlett maintained
an active and extensive correspondence with eminent poets, writers,
and literary critics; evident throughout this collected literary
correspondence are strong statements attesting to the importance
of her work.
</p>

<p>
<i>Behold This Dreamer</i> was published in Mexico City in 1959. By
1961, Jonathan Williams wrote of the book: "Your language is
cultivated, employed consistently and lucidly. To my observation,
it seems fair to say that you belong with the best of your
generation, which I would say includes May Swenson, Denise
Levertov, Garrigue, et al." Louis Untermeyer added his voice:
"I particularly like your fusion of observation and whimsicality,
as well as your avoidance of the poetic stereotypes." Rolfe
Humphries was intrigued by Bartlett’s poetic techniques: "I
enjoyed your poems and admire many...." About <i>Behold This
Dreamer</i>, Gustav Davidson wrote: "I enjoyed reading these poems.
I was impressed by their precision, clarity, and technical
competence." About the same work, critic Paul Jordan-Smith
wrote: "Your poems were begotten of a strong, imaginative sense.
My congratulations on this beautiful collection."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Bartlett's husband, Paul Alexander Bartlett (1909–1990)
was an American
writer, artist, and poet. He made a large-scale study of more than
350 Mexican haciendas, published novels, short stories, and poetry,
and worked as a fine artist in a variety of media. For more
detailed information about his life and work, see the Wikipedia
article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Alexander_Bartlett">

<p>
Elizabeth Bartlett’s son, Steven James Bartlett (1945– ), is a
psychologist and philosopher who has published many books and
articles in the fields of philosophy and psychology. For more

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
